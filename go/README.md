# Go

Just a small collection of home grown NTP tools written in Go.

Most useful are:

 * gettime
 * monitor2 (has a nice refid-converter, thanks to https://github.com/facebook/time)
 * ntpdetail
 * timediff2

Recently added:
 * ntsdetail (will actually do NTS)
 * ntsmon2 (NTS equivalent of monitor2)

> [!TIP]
> To build, doing a `go mod init <project_name>` and a `go mod tidy` first, might come in handy!
